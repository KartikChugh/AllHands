We are team microWave and this is our Micro-Volunteering sign-up/event posting platform.

You can sign up to be a volunteer or post volunteer events for others to sign up for (or both).

Under the “For Volunteers” tab, you can find and sign up for events on the “Browse Volunteer Events” page and see events you have signed up for on the “My Event Schedule" page.

Under the “For Organizers” tab, you can post events for volunteers on the "Post Volunteer Events" page and see what events you have previously posted on the "My Posted Events" page.
