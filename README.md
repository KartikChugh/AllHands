# MicroVolunteering Website by Team microWave
project-2-24 created by GitHub Classroom

We are team microWave and this is our Micro-Volunteering sign-up/event posting platform.

To view our site, check out our Heroku environment (View deployment for microwave-django).

You will be asked to log in using a Google account. Once you log in, you can sign up to be a volunteer or post volunteer events for others to sign up for (or both).

Under the **“For Volunteers”** tab, you can find and sign up for events on the _“Browse Volunteer Events”_ page and see events you have signed up for on the _“My Event Schedule"_ page.

Under the **“For Organizers”** tab, you can post events for volunteers on the _"Post Volunteer Events"_ page and see what events you have previously posted on the _"Manage My Events"_ page. You can view the event attendees, and delete the event if needed.
